# COS 422 : Computing for Data Science

### Description
A public collection for my final project in COS 470: Introduction to Information Retrieval.

My final project was focused on studying the relationship between economic factors & crime rates in Maine's 3 Metropolitan Areas given data publically available from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the United States Bureau of Economic Activity. This project mainly focused on data manipulation, data cleaning, feature & result visualization, and minor implementation of Machine Learning algorithms. Although our Professor primarily wanted us to base our project on Kaggle, I took the more difficult proposed option and sourced reliable data & topic from other sources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> Official report of the project, we weren't specified a format nor was it supposed to be adhereing to technical writing, but I attempted to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; follow a rough deviation from APA format. You'll notice the inclusion of portions from my original project proposal, this was formatted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; differently purposefully.
